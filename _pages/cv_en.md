# Luis Mesa - CV in English

With more than a decade developing software, I have an extensive experience in several fields, highlighting among them data exploitation and cloud services integration.

In the last few years I have established myself as a public cloud-based solutions architect, focused on GCP and AWS, where I design architectures to support ETL processes for both batch and real-time data processing.

Focused on developing code with thoroughness, following best practices, and always thinking about who will maintain it later, he has also had the role of Developer Advocate coordinating initiatives such as the creation of a standards guide for the company and a mentoring program within the team.
